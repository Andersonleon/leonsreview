Product Reviews:   

 I’m using the Logitech G305 LIGHTSPEED Wireless Gaming Mouse right now to write this review, and it’s absolutely fantastic! The HERO 12K sensor is incredibly precise, making every movement feel smooth and responsive, whether for gaming or everyday use. With 12,000 DPI, it’s got all the speed and accuracy needed for fast-paced action, but it’s just as reliable for general tasks.

The lightweight design makes it comfortable for long sessions, and the six programmable buttons add extra convenience. The best part? The 250-hour battery life. No constant recharging or interruptions—just reliable performance day after day. The onboard memory is another great feature, letting me keep custom settings ready to go.

For a wireless gaming mouse at this price, it’s an unbeatable combination of performance, comfort, and battery efficiency. Whether gaming or working, it’s an absolute pleasure to use!

For £60 this mouse is a dream to use, there are obviously better ones but i honestly can't think of any that matches this one at this price point.

The mouse is NOT Bluetooth and instead uses a dongle that is plug and play, you can adjust mouse settings via the Logitech G Hub app on a PC, although this is not strictly needed to use. The mouse fits in my hand pretty well, and I like the side buttons for sprinting in games and such (although they are a little mushy.) It glides along surfaces due to having no wire, and the battery is astounding, I change probably once every month or two with heavy usage due to having a very good sleep mode that automatically engages when not in use.

The only negatives I can think of is the mushy side buttons and the lack of style, but to be honest both are subjective and I honestly prefer non-RGB mouses but maybe you'll feel differently. With nearly 2 years of use I am very happy with this mouse.
