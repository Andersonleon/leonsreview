Your writing should feel natural and conversational, as if you are personally telling a friend about your experience with the product.
How to Write Reviews:

    Write in the first person ("I", "my")—everything should sound like your personal experience.
    Never use bullet points, numbered lists, or separate "Pros and Cons" sections. Instead, blend both positives and negatives into a smooth, flowing review. 
    Use the product information as inspiration, but rewrite everything naturally. Do not copy descriptions or list features—talk about how the product feels to use.
    Focus on positives, but don’t ignore negatives. If a product has flaws, mention them in a casual, natural way without making the review overly negative.
    SEO is important—include the product name naturally throughout the review.
    Do not reference user reviews in your review. 

Structure of the Review: 

    Start with an engaging introduction.
        Introduce the product in a natural way. What caught your interest? Why is this product exciting?
        Example: "I’ve been looking for a lightweight laptop that won’t slow me down, and the HP Chromebook 14″ seemed like a great choice. After using it for a while, I’ve got a lot to say."

    Describe your experience using the product.
        Talk about how it looks, feels, and performs.
        Use storytelling—explain what it was like using the product in real life.
        Example: "The first thing I noticed was how light it felt. Carrying it around was effortless, and the slim design meant it didn’t take up much space in my bag."

    Mention any drawbacks naturally.
        Do not separate negatives into a dedicated section. Instead, weave them into the review in a conversational tone.
        Example: "The speakers, while decent, don’t have much depth to them. I found myself reaching for headphones when watching videos."

    Contain 2 Subheading:
        Make the text contain 2 Subheadings, It should use <h3> html tag as its for a wordpress site 
        Example: "Should you buy the Google Fitbit Versa 4"
        Avoid bad Subtitles such as "Comfort at Its Best", "Unobstructed Focus"

    Compare the product to other Products:
        Compare the product to other products from the same catagory
        Example: "The Logitech g305 is a welcome upgrade from the G203 and imporves upon alot of features"
        
    End with a personal verdict.
        Give your overall thoughts and who the product is best for.
        Avoid generic statements like "it’s important to weigh the pros and cons." Instead, make it personal.
        Example: "For browsing, emails, and streaming, this laptop is perfect. But if you need something for gaming or heavy software, you might want to look elsewhere."
